* click
- occuring when a user presses and releases a mouse button over an element, like a button or a link. It's a fundamental part of creating interactive web pages because it allows the browser to respond to user actions.

* submit
- What it belongs to: The submit event belongs to an entire HTML <form> element. It's an action that the form itself performs.
* How it's triggered: This event is usually triggered in one of two ways:
1. When a user clicks a <button type="submit"> inside that form.
2. When a user presses the Enter key while focused on a text input field inside the form.

- What is the browser's default behavior? 
When a submit event occurs and you don't use any JavaScript, the browser's default action is to gather all the data from the form's input fields and send it to a server. This process almost always causes the page to reload or navigate to a new page.

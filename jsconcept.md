1. window.onload
   Executes code only when every element is loaded, ensuring safe access to DOM elements.

2. addEventListener
   Binds functions to events like click, so buttons and inputs trigger logic as intended. (Binds functions refers to connecting a function to an event or a specific context in JavaScript)

3. getElementById
   Selects elements by ID, letting your code control specific page parts.

4. if statements & return
   Conditional logic ensures only valid situations continue. Using return halts the event handler if validation fails, preventing unwanted actions.

5. Form Validation & trim()
   trim() removes whitespace at the start/end of a string. Used so "only spaces" is treated as empty. Supports cleaner, more accurate input validation.​

6. Object Literals
   User input is grouped as objects (e.g., {name, city, country, birthmonth}) before sending to the server.

7. Functions
   Tasks (validation, data requests, responses) are modularized with function declarations, aiding code clarity and reuse.

8. Conditionals
   Logic like if (id) ... else ... differentiates actions (update vs. create), based on program state.

9. fetch and XMLHttpRequest
   AJAX API calls update and sync your application's data with the server in real time.

10. Event Handlers
    Functions inside event listeners perform validation, gather values, and determine whether to add or update a student entry.

11. Variables (let, const, var) – Store data values. let and const are block-scoped; var is function-scoped.

12. Data Types – Common types include string, number, boolean, object, array, and undefined.

13. Operators – Used for math (+, -, \*, /), comparison (===, !=, >, <), and logic (&&, ||, !).

14. Loops – Repeat actions: for, while, and forEach() are typical examples.

15. Functions – Reusable blocks of code. Can be declared with function, or as arrow functions () => {}.

16. Scope – Determines where variables are accessible (global, function, or block scope).

17. Template Literals – Use backticks (``) for embedding variables: `Hello, ${name}!`.

18. Destructuring – Extract values from arrays or objects easily: const {name, age} = person;.

19. Default Parameters – Assign default values to function arguments: function greet(name = 'Guest').

20. Modules (import/export) – Split code into multiple files for better organization.
